everythign is a first class citizen in python
datatypes in python follows a object including ints, lists, etc.
inheritance allows you build a hierarchy of objects, they inherit desriptions and functions from each other

once a class has been defined you can make instances of the of the class
	a dining table is an instance of a table classs
	instances start with all tge defined values and behaviors of the blueprint. 

a class is mostly constructed in two parts:
	A declaration section
	implementation section which contains the functions themselves. 

when creating an object you are creating an instantiation of a class.
